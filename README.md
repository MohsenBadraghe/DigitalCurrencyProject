<h4>Overview</h4>

The Digital Currency Project is designed to retrieve data from CoinMarketCap.com, a popular website that provides information about various cryptocurrencies. The program uses the Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 packages to scrape the data. The scraped data is then stored in a MySQL database for further analysis. Matplotlib is utilized to create useful graphs and analysis based on the stored data. Finally, Power BI is used to create beautiful charts for visualizing the data in an interactive and meaningful way.
